        <h1>What is Panem?</h1>
        <p>Panem is a country founded out of the ashes of North America. After nuclear war and natural disasters tore the Earth apart, Panem was established by the last remaining humans on North America. Eventually, it grew to be a large nation and was divided into thirteen different districts.</p>
